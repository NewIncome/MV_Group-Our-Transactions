# Rails Capstone: Group Our Transactions

This is a capstone project for the Microverse Rails module, it is based on an app for grouping transactions by goal with your family/friends.


## ER Diagram for the basic Models
This is the Relationship Diagram for this project.
The user also has an icon but not selectable by the user, it's randomly selected, that's why it wasn't added to the diagram.
